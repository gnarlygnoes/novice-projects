# Novice Projects
This is a collection of early learning projects made in Go and C (along with a little bit of Rust) using Raylib, a simple library for making games, written in C. 

Each project contains more detailed information about what it is and how it can be run. 

Only three projects are really worth looking at: aliens-go, go-up along with any of the three recursive-snowflake variants.
