# Recursive Snowflake

This project was an experiment to test my understanding of recursion. Using raylib, the program begins with a centre point. Seven lines ray out from this point, and at the end of each of these lines is another centre from which seven smaller lines emerge. 

The program requires gcc and can be run by using the makefile.

On GNU/Linux run: 
make && ./snowflake
